Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:
There was no difference in the run time of 10 simulations versus 100 simulations.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:
If I wanted to be thorough, 10000 simulations would be my cap. A million would use way too much time/money.
